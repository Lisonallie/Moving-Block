### Moving Block

##### Hello and welcome to my moving block game!
The game is playable [here](https://lisonallie.github.io/Moving-Block/).

##### Why did I make this game?
This game is the result of a project I was assigned as an exercise to learn JavaScript. The objectives were to move DOM elements on the page, react to keypresses, and detect collisions. The game had to have an element that could be controlled and an element that served as food that would go to a different position when it was touched.
